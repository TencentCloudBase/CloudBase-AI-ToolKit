# CloudBase AI Toolkit - Command System Update

## Overview

This document describes the updated command system that resolves conflicts with Claude Code's built-in slash commands while maintaining compatibility across all AI IDEs.

## The Problem

The previous `/spec` command conflicted with Claude Code's native slash commands, making it unusable in Claude Code environment.

## The Solution

We've implemented a hybrid command system that works across all AI IDEs:

### 1. Claude Code Support
- **Project Commands**: Commands appear in `.claude/commands/` directory
- **Slash Commands**: Still available for backward compatibility
- **Smart Detection**: Automatic command recognition

### 2. Other AI IDEs Support
- **Trigger Words**: Use `@` prefix instead of `/`
- **Documentation**: Clear command references in each IDE's config
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Works even when custom slash commands aren't supported

## Command Reference

| Command | Claude Code | Other IDEs | Description |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Spec Workflow | `/spec` | `@spec` | Force complete spec workflow |
| No-Spec Workflow | `/no_spec` | `@no-spec` | Skip spec, execute directly |
| Help | `/help` | `@workflow-help` | Show command help |

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── README.md           # Command system overview
    ├── spec.md             # Spec workflow command
    ├── no-spec.md          # No-spec workflow command
    └── workflow-help.md    # Help command
```

### Configuration Updates
- Updated `config/CLAUDE.md` to support both `/` and `@` prefixes
- Added compatibility explanations for different IDEs
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflows

### Smart Detection
The AI automatically detects the appropriate workflow based on task complexity:
- **Complex tasks** → Spec workflow
- **Simple tasks** → No-spec workflow
- **User overrides** → Respects explicit commands

## Usage Examples

### Claude Code
```bash
/spec 开发一个用户管理系统
/no-spec 修复登录按钮样式
/help
```

### Other IDEs
```bash
@spec 开发一个用户管理系统
@no-spec 修复登录按钮样式
@workflow-help
```

### Smart Detection (All IDEs)
```bash
开发一个复杂的电商购物车功能    # Auto-selects spec workflow
修复 README.md 中的错别字      # Auto-selects no-spec workflow
```

## Benefits

1. **Cross-IDE Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across all AI IDEs
2. **Claude Code Integration**: Proper integration with Claude Code's command system
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue to work
4. **Smart Detection**: Automatic workflow selection based on complexity
5. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive help and usage examples

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
- No changes required for existing workflows
- New trigger words available as alternatives
- Enhanced help system with better examples

### For New Users
- Use `.claude/commands/` directory for command reference
- Choose appropriate trigger words for your IDE
- Leverage smart detection for automatic workflow selection

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Commands work in Claude Code via project commands
- Trigger words work in other AI IDEs
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- Smart detection functions correctly
- Documentation is accurate and helpful

## Future Enhancements

- Additional IDE-specific optimizations
- More sophisticated smart detection algorithms
- Extended command library
- Integration with IDE-specific features
